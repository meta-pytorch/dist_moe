"""Triton symmetric-memory barrier helpers.

This barrier intentionally does not use the backend-managed `signal_pads_dev_`
array from `hdl.barrier()`. Instead it launches from Python with the
`signal_pad_ptrs_tensor` copied from `hdl.signal_pad_ptrs`, which gives us a
clean way to A/B the backend barrier against the exact same signal-pad protocol.

    One ``multimem.red`` arrival increments every rank's u32 arrive count at
    once — O(1) instructions per rank instead of the O(world_size) per-peer
    CAS exchange in ``_triton_symm_mem_barrier``. Each rank then
    acquire-polls its own arrive count until all ``world_size`` arrivals of
    the current round have landed, and resets it by atomically subtracting
    ``world_size``.

    The MC/UC address split is what makes the reset safe and the protocol
    stateless across invocations: increments go through the MULTICAST VA, so
    every rank's arrive count sees every arrival, while the reset decrements
    through the rank's own UNICAST VA — the one arrive count only it reads.
    A frontrunner's freshly reset arrive count stays below ``world_size``
    until the last laggard issues its multicast arrival, so no rank runs more
    than one round ahead; and a reset never touches a peer's arrive count, so
    it cannot erase a round a laggard has yet to observe. No wait-target
    state to maintain, no monotonically-increasing counter, no wrap handling.

    Concretely, with frontrunner F and laggard S at ``world_size=2``, round r:

    1. Both arrive: F's and S's arrive counts each reach 2.
    2. F's poll sees 2; F resets its count to 0, races into round r+1 and
       arrives again: F's count is 1, S's count is 3 (S has not reset yet).
    3. S's poll needs >= 2 (not ==): 3 passes — all round-r arrivals are
       provably in, F's early round-r+1 arrival just rides on top. S
       subtracts 2, leaving exactly that early arrival (1) banked for r+1.
    4. F polls round r+1 at 1 < 2 and blocks until S's arrival lands — no
       rank runs more than one round ahead, bounding every arrive count to
       ``[0, 2 * world_size)``.

    Concurrent barriers on the same channel from different streams are not
    allowed (two interleaved rounds satisfy each other's counts).
