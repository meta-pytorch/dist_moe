"""Activation buffer planner for distributed MoE with dynamic recompute decision.

This module provides utilities for planning activation buffer usage in the forward
and backward pass of distributed MoE layers. It calculates memory requirements
and determines whether recompute is needed based on available buffer capacity.

MoE dataflow and tensor glossary
--------------------------------
A distributed-MoE layer routes each of this rank's ``num_tokens`` tokens to
``topk`` experts, dispatches them (all-to-all) to the ranks owning those experts,
runs a two-matmul SwiGLU FFN per expert, then combines (all-to-all back +
weighted sum) the results. ``num_recv_tokens`` is how many token rows this rank
receives for its local experts; its padded worst case is ``max_recv_tokens``.

Forward (per layer):
    x           --dispatch-->  x_gathered
    x_gathered  --FC13----->   h1 = [gate | up]
    h1          --SwiGLU--->   h2 = silu(gate) * up
    h2          --FC2------>   h3
    h3          --combine-->   layer output

Backward reverses this, producing a gradient for each activation:
    grad_h3 --FC2 DGRAD-->  grad_h2       (FC2 WGRAD consumes grad_h3, h2)
    grad_h2 --SwiGLU bwd->  grad_h1 (dxy)
    grad_h1 --FC13 DGRAD->  grad_x        (FC13 WGRAD consumes grad_h1, x_gathered)

Tensors (R = received-token rows; the planner sizes bundles at max_recv_tokens):
    x                 [num_tokens, hidden_dim]         layer input tokens (pre-dispatch)
    x_gathered        [R, hidden_dim]                  tokens received for local experts (FC13 input)
    h1                [R, 2 * intermediate_dim]        FC13 output; packed SwiGLU input [gate | up]
    h2                [R, intermediate_dim]            SwiGLU output; FC2 input
    h3                [num_tokens * topk, hidden_dim]  FC2 output staged for combine (saved as h3)
    grad_h3           [R, hidden_dim]                  gradient w.r.t. h3 (a.k.a. grad_h3_gathered)
    grad_h2           [R, intermediate_dim]            gradient w.r.t. h2
    grad_h1 / dxy     [R, 2 * intermediate_dim]        gradient w.r.t. h1 (both SwiGLU branches; "dxy")

For dense BF16/FP16 activations each tensor is a single allocation. For the async
block-scaled (MXFP8/NVFP4) kernels, tensors are stored as quantized bundles --
see BlockscaledStorageConfig for the row/column bundle geometry.

    """Storage geometry for block-scaled activation operands.

    A block-scaled operand is stored as a *bundle*: one contiguous allocation
    holding quantized data (qdata) immediately followed by its scale factors.
    Each scale factor covers a contiguous vector of ``sf_vec_size`` elements
    along the quantized axis.

    A block-scaled matmul quantizes along its contraction (K) axis, so the same
    activation needs two independently laid-out bundles depending on how a later
    GEMM consumes it:

    - Row-quantized: scales blocked along the feature dim (K = columns). Used
      when the tensor is the moving operand of a forward or DGRAD matmul, e.g.
      x_gathered into FC13 or h2 into FC2.
    - Column-quantized: scales blocked along the row/token dim (K = rows). Used
      when the tensor is reused *transposed* as a WGRAD operand ``grad^T @ act``,
      e.g. x_gathered and h2 into the FC13/FC2 weight gradients.

    The two layouts are not interchangeable, so a tensor consumed both ways is
    materialized as both a row bundle and a column bundle.

    Fields:
        operand_element_size: bytes per quantized storage element.
        scale_element_size: bytes per scale factor (e.g. 1 for E8M0 / E4M3).
        sf_vec_size: elements per scale block along the quantized axis
            (e.g. 32 for MXFP8, 16 for NVFP4).
        operand_values_per_storage_element: logical operand values packed into
            each quantized storage element (e.g. 2 for FP4).
        row_global_scale_element_size: bytes of per-row payload appended after
            row scale factors (e.g. 4 for NVFP4 token inverse scales).

    This function uses a Triton kernel to calculate memory requirements and
    determine whether recompute is needed, avoiding device-to-host transfers.

    - Saved activations allocated front to back:
      - Recompute mode: x
      - No-recompute mode: x_gathered, h1, h3_saved
    - Temporary activations (h2, or all if recomputing) allocated back to front

    Args:
        num_recv_tokens: Tensor [1] containing rows received by the current rank.
            With block-scaled routing this includes per-expert padding.
        num_recv_tokens_per_rank: Tensor [EP] containing the number of tokens
            routed to each rank in this forward pass.
        buffer_status: ActivationBuffer containing the activation buffer, offsets,
            and number of tokens already saved from each rank. Modified in place.
        model_config: ModelConfig containing element_size, hidden_dim,
            intermediate_dim, and other parameters needed for memory calculations.
        activation_slot_id_1: Device tensor ``[1]`` containing the
            physical activation slot. If ``None``, use the buffer's selected
            slot tensor.
        num_moe_layers_in_slot: Static number of MoE layers sharing the
            selected activation slot. If ``None``, use the buffer's current
            selection.
        inference_mode: If True, allocate only scratch temporaries and do not
            save activations or update layer/accounting state.
        num_recv_tokens_per_rank_snapshot: Optional independent output for the
            per-rank counts consumed by the corresponding backward pass.
        scratch_only: If True, use shared scratch without changing saved-state
            pointers because no backward can consume this forward.

    Returns:
        ForwardPlan with the recompute decision and memory offsets. BF16 packs
        its five offsets and selected-slot snapshot into one forward-produced
